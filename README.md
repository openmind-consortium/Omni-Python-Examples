# OpenMind-Python-Examples

Python samples for interacting with the [OpenMind Server](https://github.com/openmind-consortium/OmniSummitDeviceService). 

## Overview

This project contains sample code for interacting with the OpenMind Server. 
The sample contains code written in Python3. To interface with the 
server, it uses the [gRPC library](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/). 
This sample demonstrates how to: 

1. Connect to the OpenMind Server
2. Connect to a bridge 
3. Connect to a device 
4. Configure sensing on the Summit RC+S
5. Stream data from the Summit RC+S

## Running

`python client.py`

## Future Work

Coming soon....
